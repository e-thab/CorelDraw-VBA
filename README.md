# VBA
Some tools I've made for CorelDraw X4 with VBA. These were all made for work, so while their uses may be broad, their implementation is niche.

These may be able to be imported into an instance of VBA and run, but for the most part it will not be so simple.
This repository mostly exists for reference and posterity.

Each form is foldered next to a screenshot of how it should look, plus a txt version of its code for reference and any required files.
